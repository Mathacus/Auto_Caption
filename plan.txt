    - Ingest a video of any kind
    - Any background noise is removed from the video so that just the human voice audio can be captioned
    - The speaking audio is ingested into a tool like whisper to generate captions
    - Captions are then displayed to the user in a genius lyric style format
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Once the above has been established I then want to move on to timestamping captions so that they can be overlayed in the original video
    - This will require me to build out a simple front end that allows a user to upload a video
    - The above cleaning and captioning steps will be carried out 
    - I need to figure out a way to timestamp the video and match captions
    - The caption video then will be displayed to the user with the ability to download it.
